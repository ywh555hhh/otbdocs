# Quick Start

## What's OpenTenBase

OpenTenBase is a relational database cluster platform that provides write reliability and multi node data synchronization. You can configure OpenTenBase on one or more hosts and store OpenTenBase data on multiple physical hosts. There are two ways to store data tables: distributed or replicated. When sending query SQL to OpenTenBase, OpenTenBase will automatically send query statements to data nodes and get the final results.


OpenTenBase is a distributed cluster architecture (as shown in the figure below), which is a distributed share nothing architecture mode, each node is independent and processes its own data. After processing, the results may be summarized to the upper layer or transferred between nodes. Each processing unit communicates with each other through the network protocol, with better parallel processing and expansion ability, which also means that the OpenTenBase cluster can be deployed on the basic x86 server.

Here are three modules of OpenTenBase

- **Coordinator Node: (CN for short)**
	
	Application access portal is responsible for data distribution and query planning. Multiple nodes are in the same location, and each node provides the same database view. In terms of function, CN only stores the global metadata of the system, not the actual user data.
	
- **Datanode Node: (DN for short)**
	
	Each DN stores the partition of user data. In function, DN node is responsible for completing the request of executing CN distribution.
	
- **GTM Node: (Global Transaction Manager)**

	GTM is responsible for the management of cluster transaction information, as well as the global objects of the cluster, such as sequence.


Next, let's show how to build a OpenTenBase cluster environment from the source code

## OpenTenBase source code compilation and installation

### System Requirements: 

Memory: 8G RAM minimum

OS: TencentOS 2, TencentOS 3, OpenCloudOS 8.x, CentOS 7, CentOS 8, Ubuntu 18.04

### Dependencies

``` 
yum -y install git sudo gcc make readline-devel zlib-devel openssl-devel uuid-devel bison flex cmake postgresql-devel libssh2-devel sshpass  libcurl-devel libxml2-devel
```

or

```
apt install -y git sudo gcc make libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libossp-uuid-dev bison flex cmake libssh2-1-dev sshpass libxml2-dev language-pack-zh-hans
```


### Create User 'opentenbase'

```bash
# 1. Make directory /data
mkdir -p /data

# 2. Add user 
useradd -d /data/opentenbase -s /bin/bash -m opentenbase # add user opentenbase

# 3. Set password
passwd opentenbase # set password

# 4. Add users to the wheel group
# For RedHat
usermod -aG wheel opentenbase
# For Debian
usermod -aG sudo opentenbase

# 5. Enable sudo permissions for the wheel group (via visudo)
visudo 
# Then uncomment the line "% wheel", save and exit
```

### Building

```bash
su - opentenbase
cd /data/opentenbase/
git clone https://github.com/OpenTenBase/OpenTenBase

export SOURCECODE_PATH=/data/opentenbase/OpenTenBase
export INSTALL_PATH=/data/opentenbase/install/

cd ${SOURCECODE_PATH}
rm -rf ${INSTALL_PATH}/opentenbase_bin_v5.0
chmod +x configure*
./configure --prefix=${INSTALL_PATH}/opentenbase_bin_v5.0 --enable-user-switch --with-libxml --disable-license --with-openssl --with-ossp-uuid CFLAGS="-g"
make clean
make -sj
make install
chmod +x contrib/pgxc_ctl/make_signature
cd contrib
make -sj
make install
```

## Installation
Use OPENTENBASE\_CTL tool to build a cluster, for example: a cluster with a global transaction management node (GTM), a coordinator(COORDINATOR) and two data nodes (DATANODE).
<img src="images/topology.png" width="50%" />
### Preparation

#### 1. Install opentenbase and import the path of opentenbase installation package into environment variable.

```shell
PG_HOME=${INSTALL_PATH}/opentenbase_bin_v5.0
export PATH="$PATH:$PG_HOME/bin"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PG_HOME/lib"
export LC_ALL=C
```

#### 2. Disable SELinux and firewall (optional)

```
vi /etc/selinux/config 
set SELINUX=disabled

# Disable firewalld
sudo systemctl disable firewalld
sudo systemctl stop firewalld
```

#### 3. Create the *.tar.gz package for initializing instances.

```
cd ${PG_HOME}
tar -zcf ${INSTALL_PATH}/opentenbase-5.21.8-i.x86_64.tar.gz *
cd ${INSTALL_PATH}
```

### Cluster startup steps

#### Generate and fill in configuration file opentenbase\_config.ini .
opentenbase\_ctl tool can generate a template for the configuration file. You need to fill in the cluster node information in the template. After the opentenbase\_ctl tool is started, opentenbase\_ctl directory will be generated in the current user's home directory. After entering " prepare config" command, the configuration file template that can be directly modified will be generated in opentenbase\_ctl directory.

* Description of each field in opentenbase\_config.ini
```
| Configuration Category | Configuration Item | Description                                                                |
|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| instance               | name              | Instance name, available characters: letters, numbers, underscores, e.g.: opentenbase_instance01 |
|                        | type              | distributed represents distributed mode, requires gtm, coordinator and data nodes; centralized represents centralized mode |
|                        | package           | Software package. Full path (recommended) or relative path to opentenbase_ctl |
| gtm                    | master            | Master node, only one IP                                                   |
|                        | slave             | Slave nodes. If n slave nodes are needed, configure n IPs here, separated by commas |
| coordinators           | master            | Master node IPs, automatically generate node names, deploy nodes-per-server nodes on each IP |
|                        | slave             | Slave node IPs, the number is an integer multiple of master               |
|                        |                   | Example: If 1 master 1 slave, the number of IPs is the same as master; if 1 master 2 slaves, the number of IPs is twice that of master |
|                        | nodes-per-server  | Optional, default 1. Number of nodes deployed on each IP. Example: master has 3 IPs, configured as 2, then there will be 6 nodes |
|                        |                   | cn001-cn006 total 6 nodes, 2 nodes distributed on each server            |
| datanodes              | master            | Master node IPs, automatically generate node names, deploy nodes-per-server nodes on each IP |
|                        | slave             | Slave node IPs, the number is an integer multiple of master               |
|                        |                   | Example: If 1 master 1 slave, the number of IPs is the same as master; if 1 master 2 slaves, the number of IPs is twice that of master |
|                        | nodes-per-server  | Optional, default 1. Number of nodes deployed on each IP. Example: master has 3 IPs, configured as 2, then there will be 6 nodes |
|                        |                   | dn001-dn006 total 6 nodes, 2 nodes distributed on each server            |
| server                 | ssh-user          | Username for remote command execution, needs to be created in advance, all servers should have the same account for simpler configuration management |
|                        | ssh-password      | Password for remote command execution, needs to be created in advance, all servers should have the same password for simpler configuration management |
|                        | ssh-port          | SSH port, all servers should be consistent for simpler configuration management |
| log                    | level             | Log level for opentenbase_ctl tool execution (not the log level of opentenbase nodes) |

```

#### 1. Create a configuration file opentenbase\_config.ini for the instance
```
mkdir -p ./logs
touch opentenbase_config.ini
vim opentenbase_config.ini
```

* For example, if I have two servers 172.16.16.49 and 172.16.16.131, the typical configuration of a distributed instance distributed across the two servers is as follows. You can copy this configuration information and make modifications according to your deployment requirements. Don't forget to fill in the ssh password configuration.
```
# Instance configuration
[instance]
name=opentenbase01
type=distributed
package=/data/opentenbase/install/opentenbase-5.21.8-i.x86_64.tar.gz

# GTM nodes
[gtm]
master=172.16.16.49
slave=172.16.16.50,172.16.16.131

# Coordinator nodes
[coordinators]
master=172.16.16.49
slave= 172.16.16.131
nodes-per-server=1

# Data nodes
[datanodes]
master=172.16.16.49,172.16.16.131
slave=172.16.16.131,172.16.16.49
nodes-per-server=1

# Login and deployment account
[server]
ssh-user=opentenbase
ssh-password=
ssh-port=36000

# Log configuration
[log]
level=DEBUG
```


* Similarly, the configuration of a typical centralized instance is as follows. Don't forget to fill in the ssh password configuration.
```
# Instance configuration
[instance]
name=opentenbase02
type=centralized
package=/data/opentenbase/install/opentenbase-5.21.8-i.x86_64.tar.gz

# Data nodes
[datanodes]
master=172.16.16.49
slave=172.16.16.131
nodes-per-server=1

# Login and deployment account
[server]
ssh-user=opentenbase
ssh-password=
ssh-port=36000

# Log configuration
[log]
level=DEBUG
```
